- `Guestlist`: Links guests to events, tracks availability and attendance
- `Hostlist`: Links hosts to events, enforcing event ownership

Example table structure (see `tables.sql` for full schema):

```sql
CREATE TABLE User (
  user_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  first_name VARCHAR(100),
  last_name VARCHAR(100),
  username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE,
  user_password VARCHAR(10),
  email VARCHAR(100),
  isAdmin TINYINT
);
